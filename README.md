## Adder Architectures: RTL Implementation and Comparison

This repository contains RTL (Register-Transfer Level) implementations of 10 different adder architectures, designed generically to be synthesizable, along with a Golden Model (using the + operator) for comparison. The project evaluates these adders in terms of Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) across FPGA and ASIC (Sky130nm) technologies, testing bit widths of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits. The goal is to explore whether custom adder designs outperform the default + operator and understand trade-offs across architectures.

## Project Motivation
- Adders are fundamental building blocks in digital systems, critical for arithmetic operations in DSP, space applications, processors, and embedded systems.
- The + operator is commonly used in RTL designs, relying on synthesis tools, but its optimality is often unexamined.
- This project investigates whether custom adder architectures (e.g., prefix adders, CLA, Carry Ripple) provide better performance, area, and power efficiency compared to the Golden Model (+ operator).
- It addresses the limitations of the Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), which suffers from slow carry propagation, and explores faster alternatives like prefix adders and optimized carry-based designs.

## Adder Architectures Implemented
The following 10 adder architectures were implemented, alongside the Golden Model:
- **Basic Adders**:
  - Carry Ripple Adder (RCA): Simple but slow due to linear carry delay.
  - Carry Skip Adder: Improves speed over RCA but still limited.
  - Carry Select Adder: Faster but area-intensive.
  - Carry Increment Adder: Optimized version of Carry Select, reduces area.
- **Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)**: Reduces carry delay logarithmically, efficient for medium bit widths.
- **Fast Prefix Adders**:
  - Kogge-Stone: Extremely fast, high fan-out, area-intensive.
  - Brent-Kung: Area-efficient, moderate speed.
  - Sklansky: Fast, balanced area-speed trade-off.
- **Hybrid Prefix Adders**:
  - Ladner-Fischer: Combines speed and area efficiency.
  - Han-Carlson: Hybrid of Kogge-Stone and Brent-Kung.
  - Knowles: Optimized hybrid for specific applications.

## Project Flow
1. **Study and Design**:
   - Studied adder architectures to develop generic, synthesizable RTL patterns (the hardest part).
   - Created reusable RTL code for all 10 adder types and the Golden Model, ensuring compatibility with synthesis tools.
2. **Implementation**:
   - Implemented designs in Verilog/SystemVerilog for synthesis and simulation.
   - Ensured designs are parameterizable for different bit widths (8, 16, 32, 64 bits).
3. **Functional Simulation**:
   - Verified functionality using testbenches for all adders across specified bit sizes.
   - Ensured correct operation under various input conditions.
4. **PPA Extraction and Comparison**:
   - Compared Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) across FPGA and ASIC (Sky130nm) technologies.
   - Tested bit sizes to analyze scalability and growth trends in PPA metrics.

## Methodology
- **FPGA Analysis**:
  - Conducted post-implementation functional simulation using `.SAIF` files for power analysis.
  - Calculated power per operation by dividing total power by the number of operations, increasing accuracy and confidence in results.
  - Utilized FPGA-specific optimizations, such as carry chains in CLBs, to evaluate performance.
- **ASIC Analysis (Sky130nm)**:
  - Used default power calculation reports generated by the OpenLane Flow.
  - Analyzed area and timing using standard cell libraries from the Sky130nm PDK.
  - Compared results against FPGA to highlight technology-specific differences.
- **Bit Sizes Tested**:
  - 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit to evaluate scalability and PPA trends across bit widths.

## Assumptions
- **Carry-In (cin)**:
  - All adders assume `cin = 0` (no external carry-in) to simplify generic algorithm development.
- **Prefix Adders**:
  - Carry generation units use only Black Boxes (no Gray Cells) for simplicity, prioritizing algorithm development over fine-tuned optimization.

## Results

### FPGA Results
- **Area & Timing**:
  - Golden Model (+ operator) outperforms all adders due to FPGAâ€™s optimized carry chains in CLBs, minimizing area and routing delays.
  - Custom adder architectures (e.g., Kogge-Stone, Brent-Kung) use LUTs, resulting in higher area and timing overhead.
- **Area (Prefix Adders)**:
  - Kogge-Stone: Worst area among prefix adders.
  - Brent-Kung: Lowest area among prefix adders.
- **Power**:
  - Golden Model (+ operator) consumes more power across all bit sizes.
  - Carry Ripple and CLA: Lowest power, especially at 64 bits.
  - Brent-Kung: Best power-efficiency trade-off among prefix adders for speed and low power.

### ASIC (Sky130nm) Results
- **Overview**:
  - + operator (Golden Model) performs poorly across all metrics, as ASIC synthesis uses standard cells without optimization for specific blocks.
- **Area**:
  - Kogge-Stone: Worst area among all adders.
  - Brent-Kung: Best area among prefix adders.
  - Carry Ripple: Lowest area overall, as expected.
  - Golden Model: Resembles Brent-Kung in area (overlaps in graphs).
- **Performance (Timing)**:
  - Kogge-Stone and Knowles: Fastest for higher bit sizes (32, 64 bits).
  - Golden Model: Inconsistent timing (e.g., 32-bit slower than 64-bit due to inferred adder types like Brent-Kung vs. Han-Carlson).
- **Power**:
  - Kogge-Stone and Knowles: Worst power consumption.
  - No clear best prefix adder for power; varies by bit size.
  - Carry Ripple: Best absolute power efficiency, as expected.

### Conclusion
- **FPGA**:
  - The + operator excels in area and timing due to carry chain optimization but loses in power efficiency.
  - Consider Carry Ripple, CLA, or Brent-Kung for energy savings in power-sensitive applications.
- **ASIC**:
  - The + operator underperforms across all metrics; optimized adders are critical.
  - Kogge-Stone and Knowles dominate speed but sacrifice area and power.
  - Brent-Kung and Carry Ripple excel in area and power efficiency but lag in timing.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Prefix adders (Kogge-Stone, Knowles) are ideal for speed-critical applications but require careful consideration of area and power.
  - Carry Ripple is best for simplicity and efficiency but unsuitable for high-performance designs.
  - Choices depend on technology, bit width, and PPA priorities.
